changes:
- [x] !major bug: no way to apply dirichlet boundary conditions with gauss-legendre fluxes. update advection tests once this is done
- [x] fix: GL asymmetry in slotted disk test
- [x] remove '_thing' naming convention unless the thing is actually hidden on purpose
- [x] !major bug: 'ZS = slope_limiter == "zhang-shu"' should be ZS = limiting_scheme == "zhang-shu"'
- [x] fix: 2DZS + RK4
- [x] fix: only working tests are pytest --ignore tests/test_SodShockTube1D.py
- [x] fix: CI pipeline
- [x] for large p and N, the first step is actually the fastest
- [x] move interpolation and integration functions to fv or some other modules
- [x] look into cleaning up interpolation cache
- [x] adaptive timestep should revise "unew"
- [x] preallocate padded arrays?
- [x] plot_1d_slice and others should default to x=None, y=0.5, z=0.5
- [x] use PAD violations function for adaptive dt
- [x] ZhangShuConfig
- [x] plot n_MOOD_iters over substeps (increment of dt/4 for rk4, etc)
- [x] flux recipe 3 has issue logging fine MOOD iters
- [x] move `inplace_troubles_bc` to the MOOD module
- [x] remove redundant interpolation code in snapshot
- [x] MUSCL scheme breaks inplace compute fluxes due to not having a `mode` attribute
- [x] add HLLC riemann solver
- [x] redundant PAD checks in ZS_adaptive_dt and detect_troubles
- [x] vestigial 'half-dt' option in MOOD
- [x] clean up hydro/riemann solver modules
- [x] fix: progress bar for allow_overshoot=True
- [x] make gauss-legendre a boolean option
- [x] `avoid0` in riemann solver module should be made more public and shared by the smooth extrema detection module
- [x] move `self.timer.reset("current_step")` to called_at_beginning_of_step
- [x] buffer fv_interpolate should be optional for the single-sweep case
- [x] sort and clean `ExplicitODESolver` and `FiniteVolumeSolver` methods
- [x] buffer size is not well understood
- [x] hydro tests should cover flux recipes
- [x] add MUSCL-Hancock option
- [x] remove `fv.interpolate_muscl_faces`, `fv.slope_limiting.minmod`, and `fv.slope_minmod.moncen` and switch to `muscl.muscl.compute_limited_slopes`
- [x] MUSCL is not positivty-preserving in 2D
- [x] remove `cast` in FiniteVolumeSolver
- [x] add: `P` arg to slotted disk IC, fix: slotted disk test
- [x] automatically set `lazy_primitives=True` if `p<2`
- [x] make lazy_primitives default for advection solver
- [x] add MUSCL-Hancock option for different slope limiters and SED
- [x] troubled cell detection uses the same u_old for each substep. is this correct? ANSWER: no. i did this as a hacky fix to positivity-preservation not working with RK4. but it shouldn't.
