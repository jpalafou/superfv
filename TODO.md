- [ ] hydro version of advection of a square. show that some schemes are more robust for progressively smaller rho_min.
- [ ] redo KH with 10 snapshots. show that they start similar and diverge.
- [ ] nonlinear soundwave convergence
- [ ] gresho vortex from David sequel paper
- [ ] isothermal=True (to be ran 3D). overwrite density with rho * c**2 at the end of each step
- [ ] clean up slice syntax using `insert_slice` and `replace_slices` in the limiter and SED functions
- [ ] i don't think the double mach lower boundary looks right
