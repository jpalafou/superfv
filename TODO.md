- [ ] why does ZS3 not converge to 4th order for 2D entropy wave
- [ ] turbulence for `M_max=0.1, 0.01, ...`
- [ ] inconsistency: other arguments have "none" options but `MUSCL_limiter` expects None
- [ ] SED not equivalent between NumPy and CuPy
- [ ] PP2D limiter, modified regions of `Sx` and `Sy` are not identical
- [ ] replace `min`, `max` and `abs` in elementwise kernels with `fmin`, `fmax` and `fabs`
- [ ] add docstrings to kernel helper functions
