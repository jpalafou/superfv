- [ ] !!!fix 2D boundary conditions (2D advection, slotted disk, etc)
- [ ] !!!major bug found: 'ZS = slope_limiter == "zhang-shu"' should be ZS = limiting_scheme == "zhang-shu"'
- [ ] allow group_var_map to point to other groups
- [ ] does bc take (nvar, nx, ny, nz) or (nvar, nx, ny, nz, ninterpolations). make this consistent between the class and FiniteVolumeSolver.apply_bc
- [ ] add nvars to VariableIndexMap
- [ ] put custom types somewhere else?
- [ ] fix tests D:
- [ ] consider cleaning up interpolation cache stuff
- [ ] edit docstrings to not have the type of args in paranetheses wtf
- [ ] remove '_thing' naming convention unless the thing is actually hidden on purpose
- [ ] remove x, y, z options from array_slicer. enable multi-axis slicing instead
- [ ] remove array="w" terminology from plotting slices
- [ ] limiting_vars should be a list
- [ ] fix progress bar for allow_overshoot=True
- [ ] fix number of assigned ghost cells for transverse flux
- [ ] fix 2DZS + RK4
- [ ] clean up riemann solver primitive variable logic
- [ ] .mesh object
- [ ] switch from f"v{dim}" style to "v" + dim style for slight performance improvement
- [ ] expand README.md
- [ ] coverage
- [ ] multi-core support
