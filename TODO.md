- [ ] Gresho Vortex from David sequel paper. demonstrate value of high-order
- [ ] evolve trouble/theta as passive scalars using Runge-Kutta methods instead of taking the average across substeps
- [ ] do i need all those step log element copies? can't i just copy the step log at the top?
- [ ] can the solver args be organized?
- [ ] refactor `_compute_buffer_size`
- [ ] improve performance of shock detection
- [ ] a posteriori is not high-order for the entropy wave problem
- [ ] compare Shu Osher test with other papers
- [ ] rename `to_dict` pattern to `__dict__`
- [ ] rm: max_dt_revisions parameter
- [ ] add: compute all fallback fluxes at the top of the MOOD loop, time it separately
- [ ] count frequency of each cascade index
- [ ] why does ZS3 not converge to 4th order for 2D entropy wave
