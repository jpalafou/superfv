- [ ] hydro version of advection of a square. show that some schemes are more robust for progressively smaller rho_min.
- [ ] redo KH with 10 snapshots. show that they start similar and diverge.
- [x] double mach reflection
- [ ] nonlinear soundwave convergence
- [ ] gresho vortex from David sequel paper
- [ ] isothermal=True (to be ran 3D). overwrite density with rho * c**2 at the end of each step
- [ ] yaml instead of json in output
- [ ] include `.run()` args in config.yaml
- [ ] ic args after idx, x, y, z, t should be forced kwargs
- [ ] ic docstrings should have "Returns:"
- [ ] does the header of the zhang shu module need annotations?
- [ ] inconsistent terminology between pad and slab
- [ ] somehow the 1D advection of a square notebook gives a different result now
- [ ] `replace_slice` and `insert_slice` have inconsistent APIs
- [ ] fix or remove pickling
