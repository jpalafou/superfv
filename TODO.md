- [x] apply conservative cell averages for boundary conditions, not conservative point-wise values
- [x] Romain v=ax problem
- [x] clean up riemann solver FiniteVolumeSolver.gamma dependency
- [x] make labels optional in plot functions
- [x] vx, vy, vz are passive variables in AdvectionSolver?
- [ ] fix number of assigned ghost cells
- [ ] compare Sod Shock Tube 1D with Romain lecture a priori limited solver (and analytical solution)
- [ ] same for sedov1d, P = (gamma - 1) * 1 / h
- [ ] a priori limiting on primitive variables with lazy primitive cell averages as fallback
- [ ] move compute_dt_and_fluxes to FiniteVolumeSolver
- [ ] fix 2DZS + RK4
- [ ] switch from f"v{dim}" style to "v" + dim style for slight performance improvement
- [ ] expand README.md
- [ ] coverage
- [ ] multi-core support
