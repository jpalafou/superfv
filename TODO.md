- [x] remove `v{dim}`, `m{dim}` references in FiniteVolumeSolver. vx, vy, vz probably need to be implemented as passive scalars
- [ ] a priori limiting by default should limit each variable independently (no min)
- [ ] conservative or primitive options for a priori slope limiting
- [ ] fix 2DZS + RK4
- [ ] switch from f"v{dim}" style to "v" + dim style for slight performance improvement
- [ ] expand README.md
- [ ] coverage
- [ ] vx, vy, vz are passive variables in AdvectionSolver?
- [ ] multi-core support
