- [x] timer shows ncalls
- [x] a priori limiting for Euler
- [x] make primitives_from_conservatives, conservatives_from_primitives standard FiniteVolumeSolver methods
- [x] make snapshot of primitive variables a standard FiniteVolume method
- [x] why is "min_rho" for euler_solver no longer MPP
- [ ] remove `v{dim}`, `m{dim}` references in FiniteVolumeSolver. vx, vy, vz probably need to be implemented as passive scalars
- [ ] fix 2DZS + RK4
- [ ] switch from f"v{dim}" style to "v" + dim style for slight performance improvement
- [ ] expand README.md
- [ ] coverage
- [ ] vx, vy, vz are passive variables in AdvectionSolver?
- [ ] multi-core support
