- [x] ignore initial condition in spacetime plot
- [ ] interactive blast wave has strange rarefraction results. try again with 10% rtol. if this fails, go back to 1% and increase the resolution.
- [ ] hydro version of advection of a square. show that some schemes are more robust for progressively smaller rho_min.
- [ ] redo KH with 10 snapshots. show that they start similar and diverge.
- [x] show smooth convergence in 2D for good measure
- [ ] double mach reflection
- [ ] nonlinear soundwave convergence
- [ ] gresho vortex from David sequel paper
- [ ] isothermal=True (to be ran 3D). overwrite density with rho * c**2 at the end of each step
