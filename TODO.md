- [x] remove `v{dim}`, `m{dim}` references in FiniteVolumeSolver. vx, vy, vz probably need to be implemented as passive scalars
- [x] a priori limiting by default should limit each variable independently (no min)
- [ ] strange SED behavior in notebooks/1D_Advection.ipynb
- [ ] conservative or primitive options for a priori slope limiting. maybe limiting primitive variables will prevent the strange P profile in notebooks/1D_Advection.ipynb
- [ ] smooth convergence with Euler (P=1) like Miniramses namelist/
- [ ] make labels optional in plot functions
- [ ] Riemann solvers should take only primitive variables
- [ ] HLLC
- [ ] compare Sod Shock Tube 1D with Romain lecture a priori limited solver (and analytical solution)
- [ ] option to transform conservative cell averages directly to primitive cell averages
- [ ] fix 2DZS + RK4
- [ ] switch from f"v{dim}" style to "v" + dim style for slight performance improvement
- [ ] expand README.md
- [ ] coverage
- [ ] vx, vy, vz are passive variables in AdvectionSolver?
- [ ] multi-core support
