- [ ] ignore initial condition in spacetime plot
- [ ] interactive blast wave has strange rarefraction results. try again with 10% rtol. if this fails, go back to 1% and increase the resolution.
- [ ] hydro version of composite profile, show how NAD_rtol varies
- [ ] redo KH with 10 snapshots. show that they start similar and diverge.
- [ ] show smooth convergence in 2D for good measure
- [ ] double mach reflection
- [ ] mesh should not be in snapshots
