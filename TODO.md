- [x] ZS limiter should compute all interpolation points in a cell and cache them before returning the limited results along a specified `dim`
- [ ] fix 2DZS + RK4
- [ ] timer shows ncalls
- [ ] a priori limiting for Euler
- [ ] Euler advection
- [ ] smooth extrema detection
- [ ] vx, vy, vz are passive variables in AdvectionSolver?
- [ ] cupy
- [ ] a benchmarks/ folder. ex: benchmarks/error_convergence/
- [ ] switch from f"v{dim}" style to "v" + dim style for slight performance improvement
- [ ] multi-core support
- [ ] coverage
- [ ] expand README.md
